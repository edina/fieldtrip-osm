      Syncing is the term Filedtrip GB uses to describe the process of ensuring data and capture forms are consistennt on your device and your Cloudstorage area.

      <strong>Why and when would I Sync?</strong>
      There are a couple of reasons that you would want to perform a sync such as:
      <ul>
	<li>to deploy a custom data capture form to your mobile</li>
	<li>to upload data captured on the device</li>
	<li>to refresh a device with data that you have already captured that you wish to review in the field</li>
      </ul>
      <strong>How do i sync?</strong>

      Syncing is quite straight forward. Â The first thing you need to do is to log-in to your cloud storage area through the app. Fieldtrip GB will ask you to confirm that you want to open a connection to your cloud storage provider, please allow this.  Once logged in, you should notice a "sync" button appears in the <strong>download and Sync</strong> area. Tap this and your device will begin syncing

      Note: <em>Syncing may take some time, especially across a 3G network. The app will display a "loading" symbol while syncing is running.  Please be patient and, if possible, sync while connected to a WiFi network.</em>
